This is a pretty good set of instructions for downloading Sublime Text 2, one
of the better text editors out there. Do note that the tutorial may not list
the most current version, so you could probably get away with changing the
commands appropriately, or maybe wait for automatic updates to turn whatever
you download into the latest version.
